# GovHack2024 - AI in Government
In the GovHack 2024 competition, our team of three create an AI solution - an Information Retrieval System to facilitate public to access information from the government website.

Our primary focus was to implement an AI system in the government, culminating in the proposal of the "voicebot" app that aims to provide information to the general public through Q & A.

Information Retrieval Systems in Government
Information retrieval (IR) systems play a crucial role in government by enabling efficient access to vast amounts of information and data. These systems help government agencies and citizens find relevant information quickly and effectively.
Problem Statement
Government agencies often have to manage and process large volumes of information, including laws, regulations, policies, reports, and citizen inquiries. Manually searching through this information can be time-consuming and inefficient. Without a robust IR system, government employees may struggle to find the necessary information to make informed decisions or provide accurate responses to citizen requests.

Importance of IR system:
Better Citizen Service: Citizens can easily access government information and services through IR systems, improving transparency and accountability.
