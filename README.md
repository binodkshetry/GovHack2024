# GovHack2024
AI in Government

In the GovHack 2024 competition, our team of three create an AI solution - an Information Retrieval System to facilitate public to access information from the government website.
Our primary focus was to implement an AI system in the government, culminating in the proposal of the "voicebot" app that aims to provide information to the general public through Q & A.

Voice bots represent a significant advancement in how governments interact with citizens, offering a more efficient and accessible means of communication. By leveraging AI technology, government agencies can enhance service delivery, improve user experience, and engage with a broader audience. However, careful consideration of the challenges and risks associated with voice bot implementation is essential to ensure their success and public trust.
