https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/research-and-statistics/statistics/country-profiles/permanent-migration,"​​Australia's permanent Migration Program incorporates economic and family migration and is the main pathway to permanent residence. It includes the Skill stream, Family stream and Special Eligibility visas. The only other way to obtain permanent residence is on humanitarian grounds.

Skill stream visas

The Skill stream is designed for workers who have the skills, qualifications and entrepreneurship most needed in the Australian economy. There are seven components: 

Business Innovation and Investment

Distinguished Talent

Employer Sponsored

Global Talent (Independent)

Regional

Skilled Independent

State/Territory Nominated.

Family and Child stream visas

The Family stream allows the permanent migration of close family members, of Australian citizens, permanent residents, and eligible New Zealand citizens. It focuses on partners and parents, but also provides the opportunity for additional family members, such as aged dependent relatives, carers, remaining relatives and orphan relatives, to join their family in Australia.

Child visas allow the permanent migration of children, of Australian citizens, permanent residents, and eligible New Zealand citizens. The Child visa comprises two categories, namely Child and Adoption visas.

Special Eligibility visas


Special Eligibility visas allow former residents and certain people who served in the Australian Defence Force to live in Australia as permanent residents.

See Australia's permanent migration outcome—the Migration Program, 2022–23 (67KB PDF) for more information on the size and composition of the Skill stream, Family stream and Special Eligibility for the 2022—23 Migration Program.

The graph below shows the change in the permanent Migration Program over the past 10 years.

There are six main categories of temporary residents, which can cover stays of more than three months in Australia.


Visitor visas

Visitor visas are mostly used by people visiting Australia for holidays, tourism and recreation, or to see family and friends. People may also use Visitor visas for certain short-term business activities that do not entail working in Australia.

Working Holiday Maker Program

The Working Holiday Maker Program allows young adults to have an extended holiday and engage in short-term work and study.


Student visa


The Student visa program enables international students to come to Australia to study full-time in a registered course.

Temporary Resident (Skilled Employment) visa

Allows a business to sponsor a skilled overseas worker if they cannot find an appropriately skilled Australian citizen or permanent resident to fill a skilled position.

Other temporary visas

Other temporary visas include visas that allow people to undertake short-term, non-ongoing highly specialised work, enrich social and cultural development, strengthen international relations or provide training opportunities of benefit to Australia.


New Zealand citizens


Under the 1973 Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, New Zealand citizens can enter and leave Australia freely and live in Australia indefinitely on grant of a Special Category visa (subclass 444).

See Temporary visas granted by main visa category and type, 2022–23 (36KB PDF) for a summary of these profiles, which provides information on the size and composition of the Student visa program, Temporary Resident (Skilled) visa and Visitors for 2022–23.

The graph below shows the change in Temporary Migration over the past 10 years, as a broad overview of the main visa categories.
